## Project Title: Hoops of Suburbia

## Description
I got this idea while walking the streets of my town. Many houses had basketball hoops in varying states of decay. I thought it would be funny to take pictures of them and explain what you can learn about the house's inhabitants based on the appearance and style of their basketball hoop.
