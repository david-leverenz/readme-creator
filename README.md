# ReadMe Creator
A node.js application that accepts user inputs and generates a readme.md file.<br>
## Description
This is a command-line application that accepts user input.<br>
When run, it prompts you for information about your application repository and generates a high-quality, professional readme.md.  It has the following sections according to the user story: Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.<br>
When you input the project title it is displayed as the title of the readme.<br>
When you enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions the information is added to the sections of the readme entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.
When you choose a license for your application from a list of options then a badge for that license is added near the top of the readme and a notice is added to the section of the readme entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.<br>
When you enter your GitHub username it is added to the section of the readme entitled Questions, with a link to your GitHub profile.<br>
When you enter your email address it is added to the section of the readme entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach you with additional questions.<br>
When you click on the links in the Table of Contents it takes you to the corresponding section of the README.<br>

Please note: I made the video before noticing a slight formatting problem in the questions section.  I corrected it in the code and generated a new readme.  I renamed it to "readmeAssignment.md" so that it wouldn't overwrite the normal readme file/format I use.  It is in my repo.  I did not remake the video after this slight change.
